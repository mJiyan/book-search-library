# Listing and Searching the Book list using OpenLibrary API - Ninebarc Code Challenge

This is a list application and it is created to show coding skills to the Ninebarc (company).

Created the project using Typescript and Redux(Thunk). 

Used the Tailwind, in order to, create responsive designs. I used Tailwind because it is really easy to use and it increases the readability of the codes.

Wrote unit tests for the project components using react-testing-libraries.

Also added Webpack and Babel, in order to increase the appliction performance.

Added Eslint, and Prettier. Also, added Husky in order to prevent pushing badly formatted codes.
